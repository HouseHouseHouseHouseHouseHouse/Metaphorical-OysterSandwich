\section{Project}

    \begin{frame}{Project}
        The goal of this project was to implement a \textbf{network driver} and \textbf{network stack} at the \textbf{base level}.
        This was to be accomplished through writing an \textbf{operating system} for the \textbf{IA-32 Architecture} in the \textbf{C Programming Language}.
        The system was to be implemented as a \textbf{TFTP Storage Server}.\\
        \rule{0.5\textwidth}{0.5pt}\\
        I took on this project because I was already very involved with and interested in low-level programming, and I wanted to learn more specifically about networking.
